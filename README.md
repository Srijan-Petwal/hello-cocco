## 🧠 About

This project is my personal **3D lab** — a place where I explore:

- 🎨 Loading and animating **Blender models**
- 🌀 Creating smooth interactions using **React Three Fiber**
- 💡 Playing with lighting, materials, cameras, shadows, and scene depth
- 🔁 Learning best practices for structuring 3D components in React

> If it's 3D and on the web, this is where I tinker with it!
